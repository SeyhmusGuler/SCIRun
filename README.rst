Goals
=====

SCIRun 5 is a complete rewrite of the GUI front end and graphical components of SCIRun 4, including a more stable and 
efficient middle layer, with support for Python scripting.

Features
========

What's new in milestone F
-------------------------
* Python console works on MacOS now. Known issue when using with GUI on all platforms; some Mac python commands also seem very unstable
* Binary I/O for SCIRun v4 Matrix and Field files is enabled. Use Read/WriteMatrix and Read/WriteField just as in v4.
* TetVol Mesh type is available and renderable
* Updated module coloring while executing (matches v4)
* Eigen library received minor update
* ReportMatrixInfo layout improved
* Pure headless version can be built using a CMake flag (BUILD_HEADLESS). It supports running network files and Python scripts.
* Logging library chosen and added (log4cpp), not fully integrated yet
* Module notes have a larger range of font sizes

What's new in milestone E
-------------------------
* Manhattan connection lines
* Prototype network mini-view
* LatVol and TriSurf Meshes are full field objects with data
* ShowMesh can show nodes
* Camera control is closer to v4
* "Clear Network" is now more appropriate "New Network"
* Nicer button icons
* CreateScalarFieldDataBasic module demonstrates rudimentary color mapping of a field. Function is selectable from Python.
* ReportFieldInfo module
* Run a Python script from the command line via -s <script-name>

Network Editor
--------------
* Module selector: filterable list of modules that you can drag-and-drop into the editor or double-click to add a module.
* No middle mouse clicks are needed to connect modules: use left click instead.
* To execute a network, click the "Execute All" button or use the Ctrl-E hotkey.
* Execution of individual modules (rather than the entire network) is disabled for now.
* Saving and loading of network files is enabled. The file format is xml, but it is not compatible with SCIRun 4, so a *.srn5 extension is used.
* SCIRun v4 networks are not compatible yet, either. This feature will be implemented in a later milestone release.
* There are many menu options and GUI elements that do nothing yet. They are either grayed out or have an asterisk next to their name.
* You can filter the module selector's list, either with a simple starting string or a wildcard pattern.
* In addition to the basic "Euclidean" connection pipes, a "Cubic Bezier"-style connection is available as an option in the Network Editor tab of the Configuration pane.
* Execution progress is shown in a progress bar as in SCIRun v4.
* Each module widget has an actions button, that contains common actions that used to appear in the right-click menu.
* Double-click a connection to bring up its action menu, including delete.
* Deleting objects from the network editor uses Delete on Windows and Fn-Del on MacOS.
* New working module: SolveLinearSystem--uses the parallel linear algebra library of SCIRun v4 for a fast CG solver method.
* Help mode: click the "What's This" button (or F1 or Ctrl-H) and then click anywhere in the interface for helpful information.
* Networks can be loaded from the command line, and automatically executed with the -e and -E options as in SCIRun v4 (useful for scripting).
* Mesh geometry can be visualized with a brand new rendering engine.
* **New in milestone D**
* Multithreaded network execution. Access this by opening the developer console (hotkey '`'), and choosing "Parallel".
* Python integration, phase 1. Currently only works with Python 3.3 (will be included with SCIRun in a future release)
  - Turn on "BUILD_WITH_PYTHON" in CMake. You get a Python interpreter in the GUI with a few working commands for network building.
* TriSurf meshes can be imported from text files (*.pts, *.fac) as mesh geometry and visualized.
* Network editor provenance: another new window, accessible under the Window menu, allows undo and redo of basic network editor actions.
* The network editor background color can be customized, and is saved as a preference.
* Modules in the network editor now have a notes editor. The notes have a few formatting and position options as in SCIRun v4. They are not saved with the network yet; to be delivered in milestone E.
* Duplicate module is available as a general module action.

Renderer
--------------
* Can render faces and edges of LatVol and TriSurf meshes.
* Camera control is still in ImageVis3D mode.

In Progress
===========

* Python console, to allow scripted network editing

Planned Features for Next Release
================

* Saving module notes.
* Connection notes.
* Full Python support on all platforms, including ability to run headless without building Qt.
* Better geometry rendering, coloring and shading.

Limitations
===========

* Cannot load SCIRun 4 network files
* Limited set of modules at the moment

Platform Notes
==============

Build requirements
------------------
* OS X (tested on 10.7 and 10.8)

  - Apple clang 4.1
  - Qt 4.8
  
    + Download from http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-mac-opensource-4.8.4.dmg.

* Windows (tested on Windows 7)

  - Visual Studio C++ 2010
  - Qt 4.8 
  
    + Build from source (see http://scirundocwiki.sci.utah.edu/SCIRunDocs/index.php/CIBC:Seg3D2:Building_Releases#Installing_Qt_on_your_system_and_building_from_scratch for instructions), but be sure to download http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.4.tar.gz.

* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.10)

  - gcc 4.6, 4.7
  - Qt 4.8 
  
    + Build from source (http://releases.qt-project.org/qt4/source/qt-everywhere-opensource-src-4.8.4.tar.gz), or use system libraries if available.

* All platforms

  - CMake 2.8

    + Root cmake file is SCIRunGUIPrototype/src/CMakeLists.txt.
    + Building in the source directory is not permitted.
    + Make sure BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is on (default setting).
    + BUILD_WITH_PYTHON works on Windows, not yet (easily) on MacOS.
  

CMake Build Generators
----------------------

* Windows

  - Visual Studio 2010 C++

* OS X (tested on 10.7 and 10.8)

  - Unix Makefiles (Xcode not currently supported)

* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 12.10)

  - Unix Makefiles

Unix Makefiles notes
--------------------

* Boost must be built before the SCIRun libraries.
* Parallel make builds can be used as long the Boost target is built first, for example:

  - make -j4 Boost_external && make -j4
